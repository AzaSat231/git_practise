Take away all the chaos in my head
Can’t take the time to rest in my bed
Locked in the prison of its own making
The lies through my mind like a train Chorus:

It’s a heavy load on a road that I’m no stranger to
The wake of despair has left a scar far too deep
But I’ll still keep on going, I’ll never give in
Even when nothing is sure, I’ll just take it all in Verse 2:

A million choices and a single voice
But I’m not sure which one is the right choice
My feet are tired from a life on the run
But I don’t have a choice, I gotta keep it moving on Chorus:
